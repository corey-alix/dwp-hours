# Personal Time-Off Policy

Personal Time Off (PTO) is available to full-time employees to provide opportunities for rest, relaxation and personal pursuits.

An employee's eligible vacation time has been combined with the typical ten holidays/floaters for a combination of Personal Time Off days to be taken at anytime during the service year. PTO must be used if you are out of work for more than 3 days in a calendar year due to illness or jury duty. PTO must be used if you are out of work for more than 2 consecutive days due to the death of an immediate family member. "Immediate Family" is defined as spouse or domestic partner, child, parent, parent-in-law, sibling, grandparent or grandchild.

## How PTO is earned

Employees are eligible to earn PTO beginning on the first day of employment. PTO is calculated on a daily basis. The number of eligible PTO days an employee earns is based on hire date and increases by one day each July based on length of service up to a maximum amount of 30 days (240 hours) per year. After the maximum limit is reached, employees will continue to accrue at the maximum daily rate (.92 hours/day) for all additional years of service. If your hire date is July 1st to December 31st, your rate will increase July 1st of the following calendar year. If your hire date is January 1st to June 30th, your rate will not increase until July 1st following one year of service.

Any PTO taken is considered time worked. Therefore, you continue to accrue PTO time while you are taking time off.

An employee may not carry over more than 80 PTO hours per year without prior written approval. PTO can be borrowed in your first year of service with the company, with a written request approved by your manager prior to the time off. PTO should not be borrowed typically after the first year of service.

## Scheduling Personal Time Off

PTO should be scheduled in advance when possible. A written/email request should be sent to your manager for approval. Once approved, the DWP public calendar should be updated specifying PTO.

## PTO Pay for Terminated Employees

Any accrued but unused PTO time will be paid to a terminated employee. (Maximum 80 Hours from previous accumulative years plus accrued PTO for the current year). Any PTO time taken in excess of eligibility (borrowed in advance) must be reimbursed by the employee to the company at the time of termination through payroll deduction.

## Filling out your PTO form

Highlight the exact days taken as PTO vs sick days (3 per year), jury duty, etc. You can do this by using different colors, i.e., blue can be used for sick days and yellow for PTO. Total the hours in the column labeled 'total hours taken in month'. Send your form to Lisa Cole at the beginning of each month.
