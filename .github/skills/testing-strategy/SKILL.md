2. Reference Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
3. Provide testing patterns used in the existing codebase
4. Ensure test coverage for business logic and edge cases
5. Recommend manual testing steps for UI features

## Examples

- "How should I test this PTO calculation function?"
- "What tests do I need for this API endpoint?"
- "How do I test the admin panel functionality?"

## Additional Context

This skill promotes the project's testing standards using Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests, ensuring comprehensive coverage of business logic.
