# Code Review and Quality Assurance

## Description

Reviews code implementations against project standards, ensuring TypeScript compliance, proper error handling, input validation, and security best practices.

## Trigger

Activated when users share code, ask for reviews, or mention implementation completion.

## Response Pattern

1. Check code against TypeScript strict mode compliance
2. Verify error handling patterns match project standards
3. Ensure input validation is present and comprehensive
4. Confirm security best practices are followed
5. Suggest specific improvements or testing approaches

## Examples

- "Review this API endpoint implementation"
- "Is this code following our standards?"
- "Can you check my database schema changes?"

## Additional Context

This skill enforces the quality gates defined in TASKS/README.md, ensuring all code meets the project's standards for TypeScript, error handling, and security.
