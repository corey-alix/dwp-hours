# Architecture and Design Guidance

## Description
Provides guidance on design decisions, architecture choices, and implementation approaches that align with the project's approved tech stack and patterns.

## Trigger
Activated when users ask about design decisions, architecture choices, or implementation approaches.

## Response Pattern
1. Reference existing codebase patterns and conventions
2. Suggest solutions that align with the approved tech stack (vanilla TS, Express, sql.js)
3. Consider WSL compatibility requirements for database choices
4. Follow established API patterns and frontend structure
5. Explain trade-offs and rationale for recommendations

## Examples
- "How should I structure this new API endpoint?"
- "What's the best way to handle this frontend state?"
- "Should I use a different database approach?"

## Additional Context
This skill ensures architectural decisions maintain consistency with the project's vanilla TypeScript approach and WSL compatibility requirements.
