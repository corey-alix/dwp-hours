# Admin Employees Design Improvements

## Description

Address design and usability issues identified during a design review of the Admin Employees page (`/admin/employees`). The page displays employee cards with PTO rates, carryover hours, and per-employee balance summaries, plus search/filter and CRUD operations. Issues target inconsistent heading patterns, missing balance context labels, CSS performance anti-patterns, missing accessibility features, layout inconsistencies compared to recently improved pages, unused CSS selectors, and role badge omission.

## Priority

🟢 Low Priority — Visual polish and consistency. The page functions correctly (employee CRUD, inline editing, balance summaries, search/filter all work) but has UX and code quality issues compared to the recently improved `/admin/pto-requests`, `/current-year-summary`, and `/prior-year-summary` pages. No business logic changes required.

## Design Review Findings

Screenshot and shadow DOM captured via `pnpm screenshot /admin/employees admin@example.com`. Key observations:

1. **Duplicate/inconsistent page heading** — The page template renders `<p class="capitalize">Review and Modify Employee PTO Rates and Carry Over hours</p>` using a `<p>` element. The `/admin/pto-requests` and `/current-year-summary` pages use a `<h2 class="page-heading">` pattern with design tokens. This page should follow the same pattern.
2. **Semantic heading violation** — A `<p>` element is used for what is functionally a page heading. Should be `<h2>` for proper heading hierarchy.
3. **Balance summaries lack context label** — Each employee card has a slotted `<month-summary>` showing PTO/Sick/Bereavement/Jury Duty balance values with "avail" sub-labels, but there's no heading like "Available Balance" to explain what the numbers represent. The submit-time-off and admin-pto-requests pages established a `<div class="balance-heading">` pattern — this page should follow suit.
4. **`transition: all` performance anti-pattern** — The `.action-btn` CSS in `employee-list/css.ts` uses `transition: all 0.3s ease` which animates all properties (including layout-triggering ones). Should transition only specific properties (`background-color`, `color`, `border-color`). The `.employee-card` also uses `transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease` which is already specific — good.
5. **No `prefers-reduced-motion` support** — The card hover and button transitions don't include a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` fallback. The project's CSS Animation Policy requires honoring reduced motion preferences.
6. **Unused CSS selectors** — `.employee-header`, `.employee-name`, `.employee-role`, `.action-buttons`, `.btn`, `.btn-primary` are defined in `employee-list/css.ts` but not used in the rendered template. The card template uses `.employee-details` directly without a `.employee-header` wrapper. This dead CSS should be removed.
7. **Employee role not displayed on card** — The CSS defines `.employee-role` styles (pill badge) but the card template doesn't render the employee's role anywhere. Admin vs Employee distinction is invisible. The role should be shown as a badge in the card header.
8. **Card layout not mobile-first** — The `.employee-grid` uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(18em, 1fr))`. Other pages have been migrated to mobile-first CSS with `grid-template-columns: 1fr` by default and `@media (min-width: 768px)` breakpoints (Implementation Learning #8). Cards should default to single-column on mobile.
9. **"Acknowledge" button is unnecessary** — The "Acknowledge" button duplicates the monthly review feature at `/admin/monthly-review`. It should be removed to reduce action bar clutter.
10. **No delete confirmation differentiation** — The delete action uses a confirmation dialog (good).
11. **CSS fallback values in page css.ts** — The page's `css.ts` uses hardcoded fallback values like `var(--space-md, 16px)` and `var(--color-primary, #007bff)`. Other pages have removed fallbacks since the design token system is established. These should be cleaned up for consistency.
12. **month-summary margin uses `1em` instead of design token** — The `month-summary { margin-bottom: 1em; }` rule in the page's `css.ts` should use `var(--space-md)` instead of a hardcoded `1em` value.

## Checklist

### Stage 1: Fix Page Heading and Semantic Hierarchy

The page uses a `<p>` element for its heading. Consolidate to the project's standard `<h2 class="page-heading">` pattern.

- [x] Replace `<p class="capitalize">Review and Modify Employee PTO Rates and Carry Over hours</p>` with `<h2 class="page-heading">Employee Management</h2>` in the page template
- [x] Add `.page-heading` styles to the page's `css.ts` file (matching pattern: centered, `var(--font-size-xl)`, `var(--font-weight-semibold)`)
- [x] Remove the now-redundant `.capitalize` class usage
- [x] Clean up CSS fallback values — remove hardcoded fallbacks like `16px`, `#007bff`, `#333`, `4px`, `8px`, `1rem` from `css.ts`
- [x] Replace `margin-bottom: 1em` on `month-summary` with `margin-bottom: var(--space-md)`
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 2: Add Balance Context Labels

The balance summaries need heading labels to explain what the numbers mean (Implementation Learning #1).

- [x] Add a `<div class="balance-heading">Available Balance</div>` label above each slotted `<month-summary>` element in the page template (sibling div wrapping approach, matching admin-pto-requests pattern)
- [x] Style the balance heading using existing design tokens (matching the pattern from submit-time-off and admin-pto-requests pages)
- [x] Ensure the label is visible on mobile viewports
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 3: Add Employee Role Badge to Cards

The role (Admin/Employee) is stored but not displayed. Show it as a pill badge on each card.

- [x] Add a role badge element to the card template in `renderEmployeeCard()` — use the existing `.employee-role` CSS class (already defined, just unused)
- [x] Position the role badge in a card header row alongside the employee name
- [x] Use distinct colors for Admin vs Employee roles (e.g., Admin uses `--color-primary`, Employee uses `--color-text-secondary` or a neutral badge)
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 4: Fix CSS Transitions and Add Reduced Motion Support

The CSS has performance anti-patterns and missing accessibility features.

- [x] Replace `transition: all 0.3s ease` on `.action-btn` with `transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease, border-color 0.3s ease` (animate only properties that change on hover)
- [x] Add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block to disable/reduce transitions on `.action-btn`, `.employee-card`, `.btn`, and any other animated elements
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint:css` passes

### Stage 5: Remove Unused CSS Selectors

Dead CSS adds maintenance burden and confusion. Clean up selectors not used in templates.

- [x] Remove `.employee-header` (not used in card template — card uses `.employee-details` directly)
- [x] Remove `.employee-name` (card uses `.detail-value.employee-identifier` for the name, not `.employee-name`)
- [x] Remove `.action-buttons` (not used in any template)
- [x] Remove `.btn` and `.btn-primary` if not used in any template (the toolbar uses `.action-btn` classes instead)
- [x] Verify each removal by grep-searching for the class name in `employee-list/index.ts` and any test files
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 6: Switch to Mobile-First Card Layout

The card layout should follow the project's mobile-first CSS pattern (Implementation Learning #8).

- [x] Replace `.employee-grid` `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(18em, 1fr))` with `grid-template-columns: 1fr` (single column on mobile)
- [x] Add `@media (min-width: 768px)` breakpoint with multi-column grid layout (e.g., `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(18em, 1fr))`)
- [x] Verify card rendering at 375px viewport width
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 7: Remove "Acknowledge" Button

The "Acknowledge" button on employee cards is unclear and not needed — monthly acknowledgment is handled on `/admin/monthly-review`.

- [x] Remove the "Acknowledge" button from `renderEmployeeCard()` in `employee-list/index.ts`
- [x] Remove the `.action-btn.acknowledge` and `.action-btn.acknowledge:hover` CSS rules from `employee-list/css.ts`
- [x] Remove the `employee-acknowledge` event handler in `admin-employees-page/index.ts` if one exists, or verify no handler is wired up
- [x] Update Vitest tests if they reference the Acknowledge button
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 8: Increase Edit/Delete Button Size

The Edit and Delete action buttons on employee cards are too small for comfortable interaction, especially on touch devices. They should meet the WCAG minimum touch target size of 44×44px.

- [x] Increase `.action-btn` padding from `var(--space-xs) var(--space-sm)` to `var(--space-sm) var(--space-md)` in `employee-list/css.ts`
- [x] Increase `.action-btn` font-size from `var(--font-size-xs)` to `var(--font-size-sm)`
- [x] Add `min-height: 44px` and `min-width: 44px` to `.action-btn` for WCAG touch target compliance
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 9: Animate Inline Editor Reveal

When clicking "Edit", the inline editor appears instantly. It should use a slide-down animation following the CSS Animation Assistant rules: hardware-accelerated properties only (`transform`, `opacity`), decelerate easing on open, `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

- [x] Import `adoptAnimations` from `css-extensions/animations` in `employee-list/index.ts`
- [x] Call `adoptAnimations(this.shadowRoot)` in the employee-list's `connectedCallback` (or equivalent setup)
- [x] Add the `anim-slide-down-in` utility class to the `.inline-editor` element in `renderInlineEditor()`
- [x] The existing animation CSS already includes `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` support — verify no extra work needed
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 10: Fix Enter/Escape Keyboard Shortcuts in Employee Form

Pressing Enter while focused on any input in the "Edit Employee" form should trigger the "Update Employee" button. Pressing Escape should trigger "Cancel". The current `handleDelegatedKeydown` in `employee-form/index.ts` has an early return for `HTMLInputElement` that prevents Enter from submitting.

- [x] Fix `handleDelegatedKeydown` in `employee-form/index.ts`: when Enter is pressed on an `HTMLInputElement`, prevent default and click the submit button instead of returning early
- [x] Verify Escape handling already works correctly (code review shows it does)
- [ ] Update Vitest tests to cover Enter-to-submit and Escape-to-cancel keyboard shortcuts
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

### Stage 11: Replace Delete Confirmation Dialog with Long-Press

The delete button currently shows a `<confirmation-dialog>`. Replace it with a long-press (press-and-hold ~1.5s) gesture that provides visual feedback during the hold, and auto-executes deletion on completion. No confirmation dialog.

- [x] Remove the `confirmation-dialog` creation from `handleDeleteEmployee` in `admin-employees-page/index.ts`
- [x] Implement long-press detection in `employee-list/index.ts` using `pointerdown`/`pointerup`/`pointerleave` events on `.action-btn.delete`
- [x] Add a CSS `@keyframes delete-fill` animation on the delete button that fills the background from left to right over 1.5s, triggered on pointerdown
- [x] Cancel the animation and timer if the pointer is released or leaves the button before 1.5s
- [x] On successful long-press completion, dispatch the `employee-delete` custom event (same as current click behavior)
- [x] Remove the single-click delete dispatch from `handleDelegatedClick` for the delete action
- [x] Add `prefers-reduced-motion` support: when reduced motion is preferred, use a numeric countdown or opacity change instead of the fill animation
- [x] Animate only `transform`, `opacity`, or `background` (use a pseudo-element `::after` with `transform: scaleX()` for the fill effect — GPU-accelerated)
- [ ] Update Vitest tests for the long-press behavior
- [x] `pnpm run build` passes
- [x] `pnpm run lint` passes

## Implementation Notes

- Page component: [client/pages/admin-employees-page/index.ts](../client/pages/admin-employees-page/index.ts) (324 lines)
- Page CSS: [client/pages/admin-employees-page/css.ts](../client/pages/admin-employees-page/css.ts) (35 lines — minimal, uses hardcoded fallbacks)
- List component: [client/components/employee-list/index.ts](../client/components/employee-list/index.ts) (200 lines)
- List CSS: [client/components/employee-list/css.ts](../client/components/employee-list/css.ts) (216 lines — has unused selectors)
- Form component: [client/components/employee-form/index.ts](../client/components/employee-form/index.ts)
- Existing Vitest tests: [tests/components/employee-list.test.ts](../tests/components/employee-list.test.ts)
- Balance hydration: already implemented in page component — uses `BUSINESS_RULES_CONSTANTS.ANNUAL_LIMITS` for limits
- Follow existing design token patterns from `tokens.css` for any new color/spacing values
- All CSS changes must use `rgb()` with alpha percentages, not `rgba()`
- Use `pnpm screenshot /admin/employees admin@example.com` to capture screenshots for visual verification
- The balance heading pattern was established in the submit-time-off page — reuse the same approach (sibling `<div class="balance-heading">` above `<month-summary>`)

## Implementation Learnings (from prior pages)

1. **Balance heading added as sibling div, not inside `<month-summary>`** — The "Available Balance" label should be added as a `<div class="balance-heading">` above `<month-summary>` in the page template, rather than modifying the `month-summary` component. This keeps `month-summary` generic and reusable.
2. **Day cell min-size change is global** — Any shared component CSS changes affect ALL consumers. Be cautious with `employee-list` style changes if the component is used elsewhere.
3. **Generic screenshot utility** — Use `pnpm screenshot <route> [user] [component]` to capture any page. Output goes to `/tmp/<slug>.png` and `/tmp/<slug>-shadow.html`.
4. **PTO type color tokens already exist in `tokens.css`** — `--color-pto-vacation`, `--color-pto-sick`, `--color-pto-bereavement`, `--color-pto-jury-duty` are defined for both light and dark themes.
5. **Dead code removal was safe** — Unused CSS selectors (`.employee-header`, `.employee-name`, `.employee-role`) are defined but never referenced in the template. Removing them has no behavioral impact — confirm with grep first.
6. **Toggle state persistence via `localStorage`** — Reuse pattern from `pto-pto-card` if adding collapsible sections.
7. **Mobile-first card layout** — Use `grid-template-columns: 1fr` by default, with `@media (min-width: 768px)` breakpoint for multi-column. Do NOT use `max-width` media queries.
8. **CSS fallback cleanup** — The `css.ts` file uses `var(--token, fallback)` pattern throughout, but the design token system is fully established. Remove fallbacks to keep CSS clean and consistent with other pages.

9. **Existing animation library supports inline-editor reveal** — `adoptAnimations` + `anim-slide-down-in` class is all that's needed. The shared animation CSS already handles `prefers-reduced-motion`. No new keyframes needed.
10. **Employee form already has keyboard handlers** — `handleDelegatedKeydown` in `employee-form/index.ts` already handles Enter and Escape, but the Enter handler has a bug: it returns early when `e.target instanceof HTMLInputElement`, thinking native form submission will handle it. Since the buttons are `type="button"` (not `type="submit"`), native submission never fires. Fix: remove the early return and always trigger the submit button click on Enter.
11. **Long-press pattern uses pointer events** — `pointerdown`/`pointerup`/`pointerleave` provide unified mouse+touch handling. Use a `setTimeout` for the 1.5s hold duration, clear it on up/leave. The CSS fill effect uses `::after` pseudo-element with `transform: scaleX(0→1)` for GPU acceleration per the animation policy.
12. **WCAG touch target minimum** — 44×44px minimum for interactive elements. The current `space-xs` + `space-sm` padding on action buttons is below this threshold.

## Questions and Concerns

1. What does the "Acknowledge" button do on an employee card?
   REMOVE IT. It duplicates the monthly review feature and clutters the card action bar.
2. Should the "Add Employee" button remain in the page template or move into the `<employee-list>` component?
   KEEP IN PAGE TEMPLATE. Simpler implementation, avoids component API changes.
3. Should employee cards show computed annual PTO hours (ptoRate × workdays) in addition to the daily rate?
   NO. The daily rate is all the admin needs to see.
